A middleWare is a function which has access to request response cycle and runs during that cycle.

We can install third party middleware named morgan for logging purpose.

Update in server.js

    const morgan = require('morgan');

    // Dev logging Middleware
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
        app.use(morgan('dev'));
    }
